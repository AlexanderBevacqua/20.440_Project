<h2>Overview</h2>

At a high level, what does your repo contain / do? 
Include citations for any scripts your team did not write that are 
included directly in the repo and any non-standard methods that your 
analysis is based on. 



<h2>Data</h2>

At a high level, how was the data generated? 
If it’s too large to upload to your GitHub, where can it be accessed?
Include citations, if any.

The data, acquired from the HeRA, is located in this repository and is 
available at (https://hanlab.tamhsc.edu/HeRA/m1). The eRNA Expression Module
offers raw data csv files on specific eRNA to analyze their transcriptomic 
differences across different tissue types. Nothing about these files was changed
to facilitate the reproducibility of our work.
